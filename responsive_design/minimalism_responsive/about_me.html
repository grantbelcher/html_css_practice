        <p class="article-body"><strong>My name is John and living the simple life</strong> saved my life I used to be 
          a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even 
          appreciate any of it because there was too much. Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated,
          a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

        <h3 class="subheader-about">How I turned things around</h3>
        <p class="article-body">
          <strong>How I turned things around I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. 
          I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller 
          apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a
           bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheader-about">Now I live the simple life</h3>
        <p class="article-body">
          Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life
          and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I
            felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from
          living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
