        Watercross can be simply put as motocross on Personal Watercrafts (PWCs
        or jetskis). The exception being, these athletes compete on
        unpredictable liquid track varying from oceans, lakes and rivers. Our
        team challenges the notion of what is possible on a PWC

          <h3>Closed Course</h3>
          <p>
            Similar to motocross on the water, closed course racing is handle
            bar-to-handle bar competition that pits rider and machine in a
            personal watercraft battlefield. Reaching top speeds of over 90 mph;
            closed course racing features a buoy-marked, 1/2- to 3/4-mile track
            that is designed to keep the competition tight and fans close to the
            action.

            some of the most gifted athletes on the beach, performing two-minute
            routines in an Olympic-style format for a panel of judges.
